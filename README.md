# Chennai_Metro

Overview

Chennai Metro Route Finder is a console-based application built using Java. It leverages Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the shortest path between two metro stations within the Chennai Metro network. The application also includes JUnit tests to verify its functionality through various test cases.
Features

* Utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm for efficient route calculation.
* Offers a user-friendly console interface for easy interaction.
* Determines the shortest path between any two metro stations in the Chennai Metro network.
* Includes a set of JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of the application.
